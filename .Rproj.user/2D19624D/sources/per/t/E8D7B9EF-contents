Description: This package provides equivalent functions for the dummy classifier and regressors used in Python's sci-kit library. Our goal is to allow R users to easily identify baseline performance for their classification and regression problems. Our baseline models use no predictors, and are useful in cases of class imbalance, multiclass classification, and when users want to quickly identify how much improvement their statistical and machine learning models over several baseline models. We use a "better" default (proportional guessing) for the dummy classifier than the Python implementation ("prior", which is the most frequent class in the training set).
